                                                        Always had problems with my mum, bc no gel products were staying
                                                        for a long time and her job is difficult to save nails, these
                                                        are the only products that lets her have longer and beautiful
                                                        nails for 3-4 weeks and I think would stay for longer time too.
                                                        Can&#x27;t wait to order more products from you! The only thing
                                                        that annoyed me was colours not matching to your pictures on

                                                        got recommended Gellifique. I used it the other day and had no
                                                        reaction. The colour is stunning, it is so lovely to apply and
                                                        there was no heat spikes. <br />My client loved everything about
                                                        this product and the free samples were such a sweet idea.
                                                        <br />Now I have no allergic reaction with builder, my passion
